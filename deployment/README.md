# Trireme deployment on Kubernetes

Trireme-Kubernetes is provided as a bundle. Installation of one or more components depends on your use case. For a bare-minimum cluster deployment with Network Policy nforcement, you only need to deploy the Trireme-Kubernetes DaemonSet.

For a Quick and easy way to try Trireme-Kubernetes, follow the instructions to deploy the whole bundle as described on the main README.

## Options for deployment

Trireme-Kubernetes is built as a set of modular Micro-services. Most of them are optional and depending on your use-case you might want to deploy some or all of them.
All of those are deployed into the `kube-system` namespace

Everything is defined as standard Kubernetes YAMLs.

If metrics are collected in your cluster, InfluxDB must be started before the enforcer daemon set for Trireme-Kubernetes gets started.

For all Services (mandatory):
* `config.yaml`: Contains the configuration for everything related to Trireme-Kubernetes. The next section describes the different entries.

Trireme-Kubernetes (mandatory):
* `trireme/enforcer-ds.yaml`: A daemon set used to deploy an instance of the main enforcer binary on each running Kubernetes node.
* `trireme/enforcer-serviceaccount.yaml`: A set of minimal permissions that the Enforcer process should get to access and understand NetworkPolicies on the Kubernetes API.

Trireme-CSR (Optional):
If you don't launch Trireme-CSR you need to provide yourself a PKI for each running instance of Trireme-Kubernetes, or launch the service with the PresharedKey mode.
* `trireme/certificate-crd.yaml`: A definition for a new object type on Kubernetes API called `certificates`. It is defined as a Custom ressource definition and used by Trireme-CSR, the identity service.
* `trireme/csr-rs.yaml`: A replica set that launches the controller for the identity service.
* `trireme/csr-serviceaccount.yaml`: The minimal permissions used by Trireme-CSR in order to read and write on the `certificates` object.

InfluxDB for Time Series metrics(Optional)
All Statistics services are built on top of InfluxDB, as such if you use any of Grafana, Chronograd or Trireme-Graph, you need to also deploy InfluxDB.
* `statistics/influxdb.yaml`: A replica set that launches an instance of InfluxDB that will store all the Flow and Container metrics. Please note that this DB is not HA. You can also provide your own InfluxDB HA Database cluster.

Grafana for metrics (optional)
Grafana is a frontend used for metrics display. It can only be used if you also deployed InfluxDB. 
* `statistics/grafana.yaml`: A replica set for upstream Grafana and a service to access it from outside the cluster (type LoadBalancer).
* `statistics/grafana-setup.yaml`: A job that configures Grafana with a set of tables that display the information into InfluxDB.

Chronograf for metrics (optional)
Chronograd is a frontend used for metric display. It can only be used if you also deployed InfluxDB.
* `statistics/chronograf`: A replica set for upstream chronograf and a service to access it from outside the cluster (type LoadBalancer)

Trireme-Graph for an example of visual graphic display (optional)
Trireme-Graph is a very simple frontend that queries InfluxDB and displays visually all the flows (authorized or rejected) in your cluster between different pods.
* `statistics/graph.yaml`: A replica set for Trireme-Graph and a service of type LoadBalancer to be able to access it from outside the cluster.

## Configuration file

Configuration is filled in through a standard Kubernetes ConfigMap (`config.yaml`). There is a single ConfigMap used for the whole bundle.

```
  # Logging: Could be debug, info, warning, error. Info is recommended.
  trireme.log_level: info
  trireme.log_format: human

  # Trireme-Enforcer configuration.
  # Authentication type. Value can be PSK or PKI. (More on the dedicated section)
  trireme.auth_type: PKI

  # Trireme-CSR configuration.
  # defines where to find the CA Certificate and the CA Private Key in case you decide to mount it manually into the pod.
  # Only required if the Trireme-CSR identity service is used.
  trireme.signing_ca_cert: /opt/trireme-csr/configuration/ca-cert.pem
  trireme.signing_ca_cert_key: /opt/trireme-csr/configuration/ca-key.pem

  # Trireme-Statistics configuration.
  # Only required if the metrics and statistics servie is used.
  # InfluxDB endpoint (Collector Interface). By default point to a Cluster Service.
  # Change the DB detail in case you want to use your own InfluxDB Instance.
  trireme.collector_endpoint: http://influxdb:8086
  trireme.collector_user: aporeto
  trireme.collector_password: aporeto
  trireme.collector_db: flowDB
  trireme.collector_insecure_skip_verify: "false"
  # Grafana Configuration.
  # Only required if Grafana initial configuration has to be performed. 
  trireme.grafana_endpoint: http://grafana:3000
  trireme.grafana_user: admin
  trireme.grafana_password: admin
  trireme.grafana_access_type: proxy
```
